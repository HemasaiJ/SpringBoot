# SpringBoot

This Project contains the basic CRUD operations in mongoDb.

C - creating a student 

R - Reading all the students (yet to implement)

U - Update student based on Id.

D - Delete student based on ID.

For someone who is very new to spring boot application development, they can understand this easily. 

Used MVC architecture in the project (Model, View, Controller)
